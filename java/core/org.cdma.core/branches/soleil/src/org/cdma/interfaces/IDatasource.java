/**
 * @brief IDatasource is used by the main Factory to detect plug-in compatibility.
 * 
 * The main focus of this interface is to determine, which plug-in can read the URI 
 * and if possible to which one it belongs to.
 * <p>
 * It distinguish mostly two things: that the plug-in can read the given URI and if
 * the target was written using that plug-in. That last point means that Extended Dictionary
 * mechanism can be used.
 * <p>
 * It can also be used, by the main Factory, to discover if a specific targeted URI
 * is considered by plug-ins as a DATASET or a simple FOLDER. More particularly if
 * the URI interpreted by this plug-in's instance can be browsed to find a IDataset.
