This section lists C++ coding recommendations for CDMA project.

It distincts two aspects: programming style and programming practices.
The recommendations are based on established standards collected from a number of sources, individual experience, project requirements/needs.

Our main motivations are:
 * to maximize code readability, independently of the IDE or Source code editor used,
 * to ensure source code homogeneity among all the different parts of the project,
 * to get the most maintainable code as possible.
