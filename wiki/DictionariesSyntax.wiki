#summary Dictionaries general documentation

Welcome to the dictionaries general documentation. It describes how CDMA dictionaries works and their major interactions.

The content of this section is applicable what ever the programming language is used and for all plug-in of the CDMA. It introduces the general and expected behaviour of the Extended Dictionary Mechanism.

= Introduction =

The Extended Dictionary Mechanism is provided by the Core. It is a non-customisable service (i.e. interfaces to implement): the behaviour is the same what ever the plug-in is. It permits to have a virtual view, that is independant and quite different, of the underlying data format.

The dictionary describes how data should be presented, its main properties and how to get it. 
A CDMA dictionary is compound of 3 parts:
  * the [#Concept_file concepts file] which presents physical measurements and what to expect when getting it
  * the [#View_file view file] which structurates the data tree that the application will use
  * the [#Mapping_file mapping file] which describes how a particular plug-in will access and construct its data
