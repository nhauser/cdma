#summary CDMA dictionary.

= Introduction =

This section is intended to documents the CDMA keywords used through the dictionary mechanism.
Each data item in a data set is identified by a unique keyword.
The CDMA dictionary should apply for Photon and Neutron science.

It contains, like the CIF dictionary, a core dictionary with generic keywords, and extensions that applies to specific experimental technics (SAX, EXAFS, Powder diffraction,...)

At this early stage, this is a tentative list:

 * [CoreDict Core dictionary]
 * [SAXSDict Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) extension]
 * [XASDict X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) extension]
 * [XRFDict X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) extension]
 * [PowderDiffrDict Powder diffraction extension]
 * [TomoDict Tomography extension]
