= Setting up The CDMA library =

CDMA classes are accessible through the namespace `cdma`.
The main class a C++ client uses is {{{cdma::Factory}}}. This is a singleton object. Every C++ client must begin and ending with it:

{{{
int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
  
  ...
  
  // The first action is the Factory initialization
  cdma::Factory::init( "Plugins_path" );

  ...

  // Calling the cleanup method is necessary to ensure
  // the correct termination of the CDMA core library
  cdma::Factory::cleanup();
}
}}}
