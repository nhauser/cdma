The Python bindings of CDMA come with two sets of documentation files. 
 * [PythonUsersGuide the users guide]
 * [http://cdma.googelcode.com/svn/wiki/pydoc/index.html and the Python binding API documentation]
If you just want to use the Python binding to use CDMA from within your Python scripts the former one is entirely enough. However, if you want to contribute to the binding development the API documentation of the Python bindings is what you want to read to get an idea how the C++ wrapper code works.
