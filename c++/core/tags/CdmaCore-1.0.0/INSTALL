Installation instructions for the CDMA core library
===================================================


1.) Building the source code with SCONS
    -----------------------------------

This section describes how to compile the CDMA core library with SCONS under
Linux.

1.1) Required libraries and tools 
     ----------------------------

The following tools are required:
-) scons (http://www.scons.org/) - the build system used
-) pkg-config (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config) - a build 
   configuration tool 

The following libraries are required:
-) yat - a utility library used by SOLEIL
-) libxml2 - an XML parsing library

All these tools and libraries (except YAT) should be available from the package
repositories of your distribution (if not see the 

1.2) Building the code:
     ------------------

If pkg-config is configured correctly the following command in the root of the
source tree will build the code

$> scons

YAT does not support pkg-config yet. So if your YAT library is not installed at
a default installation you can add its header and binary installation paths
using build variables

$> scons YATLIB=/opt/yat/lib YATINC=/opt/yat/include 

to inform SCONS where to look for YAT headers and binaries. 

1.3) Install the library
     -------------------

In the most simplest case installation can be done with 

$> scons install

In this case (by default) everything will be installed under /usr/local (runtime
binaries under /usr/local/lib, headers in /usr/local/include, and the
documentation in /usr/local/share/doc/libcdmacore). To change the installation
prefix use the PREFIX build variable like this

$> scons PREFIX=/opt/cdma/ install

in which case everything will be installed below /opt/cdma. 
You can further tweak the installation locations using the following build
variables
   LIBDIR - installation path of the library's binaries
   DOCDIR - installation path of the documentation
   INCDIR - installation path for headers
Using one of these three build variables will override the PREFIX settings 
for binaries, headers, or documentation respectively. 
A pkc-config file (cdmacore.pc) will be created during the build and is
installed under the same directory as the library binaries in a subdirectory
named pkgconfig. If you want to use pkg-config to build code that uses the CDMA
core library you have to add this directory to you PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
variable. For instance in the example above one has to type 

$> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/cdma/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

on a terminal or add this line to your local .bashrc to make CDMA accessible for
pkg-config.
