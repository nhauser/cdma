CDMA C++ python bindings
========================

This package contains the source distribution of the Python bindings for the 
CDMA C++ framework. If you are not familiar with building Python packages from
sources you should may look for binary packages available for your platform. 

1.)Installation:
   ------------

In order to build the source distribution the following additional packages
are required: 
-> CDMA C++ framework
-> BOOT Python 
-> Python development files
-> Numpy - python numerical array package with development files


1.1.) Installation on Linux
      ---------------------

On Linux type the following command line 

$>python setup.py install 

will install the python package to the default location of your Python
installation. In most cases this requires you to have administrative permissions
on your system. You can install the package locally to some location where you
have write permissions with

$> python setup.py install --home=<INSTALLATION PATH>

where <INSTALLATION PATH> denotes the location on the file system where the
package should be installed.

If you want to compile the code with C++11 support use 

$> python setup.py --with-cpp11 install

For a successful build cdmacore must have its pkg-config file installed at the
right place. This is usually not a problem if cdmacore is installed in default
locations. However, if the cdmacore library is installed in some custom location
you need to add the path to its cdmacore.pc file to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH in your
environment.

1.2.) Installation on Windows
