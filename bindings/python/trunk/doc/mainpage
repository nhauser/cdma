\mainpage CDMA Python manual

This Python module provides bindings to the CDMA C++ library. 
The documentation consists into two parts: 
 - \ref developer_doc
 - and \ref user_doc

The former one is only interesting for you if you plan to contribute code to
this Python binding. If you only want to use the binding from Python read the
user documentation.

\section installation Installation

\subsection installation_sources Installing from sources
The module follows the standard Python installation procedure using distutils. 
To build the code run 
\verbatim
$> python setup.py build 
\endverbatim
in the root of the modules source directory. Installation starts with 
\verbatim
$> python setup.py install
\endverbatim
which installs the module in the default location of your Python installation.
In most cases this would require you to have administrative permissions on the
system you want to install the module. 
If you want the module installed in your local home directory (without admin
permissions required) you can use 
\verbatim
$> python setup.py install --home=<PATH TO YOUR LOCAL DIRECTORY> 
\endverbatim
which will install the module to a user defined location. 
In the later case you may need to add the installation path to the PYTHONPATH
environment variable to make the module available to your Python interpreter.
