\page user_doc User documentation

Welcome to the users documentation of the CDMA Python bindings. If you only want
to use CDMA in your Python code you are at the right place. If you have already
had a look on the C++ and Java API documentation you may find that the Python
bindings look entirely different from what you have seen there. The reason for
this is simple: the primary design goal for the Python binding was
to keep the interface as simple and pythonic as possible. Consequently, I have
stripped down the C++ API to a very simple Python API which treats most of
the objects in CDMA as containers. If you find that some things look quite
similar to h5py (a Python interface to HDf5) then you are entirely right: h5py
was quite an inspiration for this binding. This manual is split into several
parts. In the next section a short introduction to CDMA will be given. 
Section \ref udoc_basics shows gives an overview over the different types
provided by the CDMA Python bindings. Finally section \ref udoc_examples 
shows some real world examples.

Lets start with a quick introduction to CDMA. CDMA maps one or more files and 
the data stored in them on a tree consisting of \a Groups, \a DataItems, 
\a Dimensions, and \a Attributes as shown in the figure on the right. 
For users acquainted with HDF5 this picture fill look quite familiar. 
Indeed, except for \c Dimensions, CDMA provides you with a data organization
quite similar to HDF5. Groups and DataItems can additionally hold attributes 
with additional meta-data. Access to data is provided in two different ways

<ul>
<li> \it raw access - is just what you see in the figure above</li>
<li> a dictionary based approach </li>
</ul>

As the Python bindings do not yet support dictionary access a detailed
description will be omitted. In the  \a raw mode, data is accessed directly by
traversing through the data tree.
To represent the data tree the Python bindings provide a couple of types
(classes). Namely
    \li \c Group 
    \li \c DataItem
    \li \c Attribute
    \li \c Dimension
    \li and \c Dataset

where the later one acts only as an entry level type to the data-tree. 


\section udoc_basics Baisc usage

To use CDMA from python the \c cdma module must be loaded with
\code
import cdma
\endcode
CDMA organizes data in so called datasets. To open a dataset use
\code
dataset = cdma.open_dataset("file:/path/to/file")
\endcode
\c open_dataset takes one argument which is the URL to the dataset (here a file). 
Datasets are the entry level objects for the data tree. To get access to the
tree use the \c root_group attribute of the \c Dataset instance.
\code
dataset.root_group
\endcode


\subsection udoc_groups Group objects
Groups are the fundamental container types in CDMA you can iterate over a
group with
\code
for o in dataset.root_group:
    print o 
\endcode
This code will iterate over all child objects of the root group. There exist
some convenience functions to filter for a particular type of child objects
\code

#iterate over all children of type DataItem
for o in cdma.get_dataitems(dataset.root_group):
    print o

#iterate over all children of type Group
for g in cdma.get_groups(dataset.root_group):
    print g

#iterate over all children of type Dimension
for d in cdma.get_dimensions(dataset.root_group):
    print d

\endcode
To access a particular item below a group the \c [] operator can be used with
\code
root = dataset.root_group
group = root["groupname"]
item  = root["dataitemname"]
dim   = root["dimensionname"]
\endcode
Unlike for instance \c h5py the Python bindings to CDMA do not support access
via a path as the argument to \c []. Only children linked directly below the
group can be accessed using their name. 
A group object has several read only attributes that can be used to obtain some
more detailed information about an object.
\code
group = dataset.root_group["datagroup"]
group.parent     #reference to the parent group (in this case the root group)
group.root       #a reference to the root group of the data tree
group.name       #the full name of the group
group.location   #path to the group within the tree
group.short_name #the key of the group (in this case "datagroup")
\endcode
There is one more member attribute to \c Group which will be discussed in the 
\ref udoc_attributes section of this manual.

\subsection udoc_dataitesm DataItem objects
Instances of \c DataItem are possible child nodes of groups. Unlike groups a
data item cannot hold child objects (they are leaves in the terminology of
trees) except attributes. 
Data items contain the data stored in the tree. This data can be either of a
numerical or a string type. In addition data can be stored either as a scalar
value or as a multidimensional array. An instance of \c DataItem possesses the 
same attributes as an instance of \c Group (see the previous section) along 
with some additional attributes
\code
item = group["itemname"]

item.rank        #number of dimensions
item.shape       #tuple with the number of elements along each dimension
item.size        #total number of elements stored in the item
item.unit        #physical unit of the data stored in the item
item.type        #data type as numpy type string
item.description #description of the item as string
\endcode
To obtain all data from an object use the \c [...] like in this example
\code
item = group["itemname"]

data = item[...]
\endcode
In the case of a string item the returned value will be a string. Scalar numeric
items return data as single instances of a native Python data type. 
Multidimensional data is returned as numpy array which makes it easy to use the
data. For numerical multidimensional data more sophisticated slicing operations
can be used. The following code for instance reads only a portion of the total
data 
\code
item = group["itemname"]

data = item[256:512,1]
\endcode
All slicing operations that can be done with numpy arrays can be used. 

\subsection udoc_attributes Managing attributes

Group and data item objects have an attribute \c attrs attribute. This is an
instance to an \c AttributeManager object. It is used to retrieve attributes
attached to a group or data-item. 
The usage of this attribute is fairly simple you can either iterate over all
attributes
\code
g = dataset.root_group("datagroup")

for a in g.attrs:
    print a
\endcode
or access attributes directly by there name
\code
g = dataset.root_group("datagroup")
a = g.attrs["attrname"]
\endcode
In either case attributes are returned as instances of type \c Attribute. 
Obtaining the data from such an object is like reading the data from a data item
(see above). Each instance of \c Attribute provides some attributes which hold
further information about the attribute
\code
a = g.attrs["attrname"]

a.size      #the total number of elements in the attribute
a.shape     #number of dimensions along each dimension of the attribute
a.type      #data type as numpy type string
a.name      #name of the attribute           
\endcode
