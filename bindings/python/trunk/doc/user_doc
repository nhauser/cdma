This is the part of the documentation you should read if you only want to use
CDMA from within Python. One of the design goals was to keep the interface to
CDMA as simple and \it pythonic as possible. A good example for wrapping a
complex C interface into a very simple and intuitive interface is the h5py
interface for HDF5 in Python. 
For sake of simplicity most of CDMA set/get attribute are represented as
properties in the Python classes. 

\section udoc_classes Python types overview

The CDMA Python bindings provides types  
    \li \c Dataset entry level object
    \li \c Group the basic data holding container
    \li \c Dimension describes a CDMA dimension
    \li \c DataItem the data holding object
    \li and \c Attribute which represents a CDMA attribute.



\section udoc_basics Baisc usage

To use CDMA from python the \c cdma module must be loaded with
\code
import cdma
\endcode
CDMA organizes data in so called datasets. To open a dataset use
\code
dataset = cdma.open_dataset("file:/path/to/file")
\endcode
\c open_dataset takes one argument which is the URL to the dataset. In this case
the dataset is a single file. A dataset itself acts as a container for groups,
data-items, and dimensions. All objects can be accessed via the root group of a
dataset which itself is a read-only attribute of the dataset object
\code
dataset.root_group
\endcode
Groups are the fundamental container types in the CDMA world.

Group objects are the primary containers in the CDMA world

\section udoc_examples Examples

In this section we will discuss the examples shipped with the source
distribution. 

\subsection udoc_ex1 ex1.py

This examples shows basic navigation and iteration over all entities in a CDMA
tree.
\includelineno ex1.py

Line 4 imports the CDMA Python bindings. In Line 7 a handler to a dataset is
opened using the \c open_dataset function. The dataset has a read-only attribute
referring to is root group.
